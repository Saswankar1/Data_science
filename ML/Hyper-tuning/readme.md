# Hyperparameter Tuning in Machine Learning

## What is Hyperparameter Tuning?

* Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the optimal set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model.
* Hyperparameters are configuration settings that are external to the model and cannot be learned from the data.
* They control the model's learning process and affect its performance.

## Why is Hyperparameter Tuning Important?

* Choosing the right hyperparameters can significantly improve model performance.
* Default hyperparameters may not be the best for a specific dataset or problem.
* Hyperparameter tuning can help prevent overfitting or underfitting.

## Common Hyperparameters to Tune

* Learning rate
* Number of trees in a random forest
* Number of neurons in a neural network
* Regularization parameters (e.g., L1, L2)
* Kernel parameters in SVMs

## Hyperparameter Tuning Methods

* **Grid Search:** Exhaustively tries out all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified grid.
* **Random Search:** Randomly samples combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range.
* **Bayesian Optimization:** Uses a probabilistic model to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters, reducing the number of trials needed.


**## Additional Considerations**

* Hyperparameter tuning can be computationally expensive.
* The optimal hyperparameters may vary depending on the dataset and problem.
* It's important to balance the time spent on hyperparameter tuning with other model development tasks.
