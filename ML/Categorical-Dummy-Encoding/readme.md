### Categorical Variables

Categorical variables represent categories or labels and can take on a limited, fixed number of values. These values can be numerical or non-numerical, and examples include colors, types of animals, or education levels. Categorical variables are often used in machine learning to represent qualitative data.

### Dummy Variables

Dummy variables, also known as indicator variables or binary variables, are used to represent categorical data with two or more categories. They are typically created by converting categorical variables into a numerical format, with each category assigned a binary value (0 or 1). Dummy variables are useful in regression analysis and other statistical modeling techniques.

### One-Hot Encoding

One-Hot Encoding is a technique used to represent categorical variables as binary vectors. Each category is converted into a separate binary feature, and only one of these features is "hot" (1) for a particular observation, while the others are "cold" (0). One-Hot Encoding is commonly employed in machine learning algorithms, especially when working with categorical data and models that require numerical input.
